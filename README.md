## About The Project

---

![Flask Blog Site](/static/imgs/FlaskBlog.png)

There are many great Travel Blogs available online; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so we created this enhanced one. We want to create a Travel Blog so amazing that it'll be the only one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:

- Your time should be focused on enyoing yourself while traveling, 
- You shouldn't worry about sharing  your experience online with outsiders but with other travel enthusiasts

Of course, no blog will serve all people since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this Travel Blog, and... good travels! :joy:

Use the README.md to get started.
